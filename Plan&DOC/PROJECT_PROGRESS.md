## 🔵 Could-Have Functional Requirements (100% COMPLETED)
[✅] FR-32: Recurring Tasks

## 🔵 Could-Have Non-Functional Requirements (90% COMPLETED)
[🔮] NFR-10: Multi-Language ➡️ **FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION**
  - **Academic Justification**: Internationalization requires comprehensive content management system for 500+ UI strings across the application. Translation infrastructure and localization testing would extend project timeline by 3-4 weeks without adding technical complexity. Multi-language support is primarily a business/marketing feature rather than a core technical demonstration. AI chat feature translation would require advanced NLP processing beyond current project scope.
