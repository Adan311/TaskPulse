# TaskPulse: Your All-in-One Productivity Hub

In today's digital world, productivity is fragmented. We juggle countless tabs and applications—a to-do list here, a calendar there, separate apps for notes, project boards, and file storage. This constant context-switching drains focus and creates digital clutter.

**TaskPulse** is the solution. It's a unified, full-stack productivity platform designed to consolidate your entire workflow into a single, elegant application. By seamlessly integrating task management, calendar scheduling, AI assistance, and real-time collaboration, TaskPulse eliminates the need for multiple tools, allowing you to manage your work and life from one central hub.

VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<public_anon_key>

# Google APIs
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=<gemini_api_key>
VITE_GOOGLE_CAL_CLIENT_ID=<oauth_client_id>
VITE_GOOGLE_CAL_API_KEY=<calendar_key>
```

### 3. Install & Run
```bash
npm install          # install deps
npm run dev          # start Vite dev server
```

A browser window should open at `http://localhost:5173`.
